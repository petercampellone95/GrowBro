PCB Design Notes 
Updated: 9/21/2020

ADC
	Internal ADC limited to 2600mV despite datasheet saying its capable of 3900mV
	Noisy, recommend 0.1uF per ADC input pin
	Might be better to use an external I2C/SPI ADC if higher precision reqd.
	

PCB Reqs
	Need BT in next rev (different ESP32-S2 PN)
	Smaller Vreg/Cheaper?
	Confirm holes sized for specific screw sizes
	Add 0.1uF on some ADC pins to test	

	
PCB Fixes
	C1/C5 ref des issue (fixed?)
	C1/C5 silkscreen off of vias
	Replace S1 with a switch that isnt dog shit
	CHIP_EN circuit needs pull-up and possible discharge circuit, reference datasheet

	Get rid of JTAG/USB headers
	Get slide switch for boot mode instead of jumper
	Actually order DC jack or get a smaller power input connector, rated max ~600-800mA
	External ADC, SPI/I2C, 8 CH
	Better noise mitigation strategies, lots of noise on ADC pins in current rev.
